# Customer-Segmentation-RFM

# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

This project performs **Customer Segmentation** using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis approach on the **Online Retail dataset (UCI Repository)**.  
The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and provide insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## 📌 Project Description
- Dataset: **Online Retail Dataset (UCI Repository)**  
- Analyze customer purchase behavior based on:  
  - **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase  
  - **Frequency (F):** How often they made purchases  
  - **Monetary (M):** How much money they spent  
- Assign RFM scores to each customer  
- Segment customers into groups based on their scores  
- Suggest marketing strategies for each group (e.g., discounts for loyal buyers, re-engagement for inactive ones)
